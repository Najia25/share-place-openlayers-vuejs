=> The app uses Geolocation API to fetch the users current location.
=> Upon getting the user coordinates a sharable link is generated, a loading modal is visible and the location is then shown in the map.
=> I have used OpenLayers library along with OpenStreetMap to render the map.
=> Clicking on the share button copies the link to the clipboard using clipboard API.
=> Pasting the copied link in browser address bar shows a different view with the map rendered and the formatted address in the top bar.
=> Clicking the share new button redirects the user to the home page.
=> The same procedure repeats for a custom address that user can input in the input field.
